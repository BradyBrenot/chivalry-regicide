=================

A team-based game mode. One king is assigned per team at one time. Kill the enemy's king to score a point. When your king is dead, your team has a double-length spawn wave; then, another king is chosen and it begins again. King assignment is random and non-negotiable. First team to reach the kill goal wins. Playable on TD and LTS levels.
